# Introduction to the test

Welcome to the development tech test for DIT DDaT software developers.

This technical test is expected to take around 1 hour of your own time. We code using Python and JavaScript (NodeJs) so we recommend using one of those to complete your test. Please do not use Haskell, Erlang, Perl, C, C++, Matlab or Assembly.

Once you have completed the test please push this to a web-based repository; we use github so ideally that and to be shared with @ mforner13, @ LaurenQurashi, @ gabelton, and @ nahmed99.
Please complete this task in as near a way as you would in your normal day to day work and provide instructions on how to run your code. 
Deadline for returning the test is Tuesday, 7 Feb 2023 @ 11:55 pm
When assessing your work the panel will score your solution based on multiple factors such as the quality of your code, tests, organization and readability. Any signs of plagiarism can result in an automatic fail. 

# The test
The test is to create a time parsing function in a similar format to splunk.
Splunk uses a special format for "relative time modifiers" which allows you to take a time and modify it.
We would like you to implement a simplified version of this (this is a subset of what splunk supports).
The format we would like you to parse looks like this:
now()-1d@d

You can see what you need to support in the definitions below.
Please do not use a library to achieve this though you may use some libraries to help with testing.
All dates and times are to be treated as UTC.
A parse function, this needs to take in a string and return a date e.g:

parse('now()+1d');

Definitions
These are all of the scenarios that you need to support for the test.
Operators
Operator	Name	Description
now()	modifiers	The time now in UTC†
+	plus	Add the offset to the date modifier
-	minus	Subtract offset from the date modifier
@<time_unit>	snap	Rounds down to this time unit
† Splunk supports a lot of modifiers for this test you only need to support now().
Time units†
Unit	Name
s	second
m	minute
h	hour
d	day
mon	month
y	year
† Splunk supports a lot more time units you just need to support the ones in this list.

Examples
Using a date and time of 2022-01-08T09:00:00Z:

String	Date	Description
now()+1d	2022-01-09T09:00:00.00Z	Now plus 1 day
now()-1d	2022-01-07T09:00:00.00Z	Now minus 1 day
now()@d	2022-01-08T00:00:00.00Z	Now snapped to day
now()-1y@mon	2021-01-01T00:00:00.00Z	Now minus on year snapped to month
now()+10d+12h	2022-01-18T21:00:00.00Z	Now plus 10 days and 12 hours
